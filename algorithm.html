    <h2>What the algorithm is supposed to do</h2>
    
<p>What we wanted our algorithm to do was for the user to input their zodiac sign and then receive a result.
In the result, the user should receive the following information: the element associated with their zodiac sign, recommendations for four different books specifically about the user’s zodiac sign, and a randomly selected book (from four possible options) that covers all zodiac signs. Additional information for all books should include the title, year, ISBN, author, and a link to the book on Libris.
The pseudocode is written first to demonstrate what we want the algorithm to do. It starts with launching the program, what the user needs to do, and what the result for the user should be. We also included what happens if the zodiac sign is not on the list, as well as a function that, in addition to the four zodiac-specific books, randomly selects a book that covers all zodiac signs and then concludes.
The pseudocode is 50 lines long and includes everything required by the task, such as variables and if-else statements.
Once the pseudocode was written, we attempted to implement it using Python, as this was covered in our lecture. It wasn’t easy to get the solution right, but after some research, we managed to do it. Initially, we thought the user would enter their birth date, but we later decided that the user would only need to enter their zodiac sign to get their result.

    <h2>The algorithm in pseudocode</h2>
<pre>
    
    Start the Program
	1	Create a function that takes a zodiac sign from the user:
		Create a list of zodiac signs, each with its element and associated book recommendations.
	2	For each zodiac sign in the list, include:
	    The element associated with the zodiac sign:
		Example: “Aries” has the element “Fire”, “Taurus” has “Earth”, “Gemini” has “Air”, etc.
	3	Add four book recommendations for each zodiac sign:
		Each book should include the following information:
		The title of the book
		ISBN number
		Author’s name
		Publication year (if available)
		A link to Libris where the user can find the book
	4	In the function, check if the user’s zodiac sign is in the list:
		If the zodiac sign is found, return its element and list of books
		If the zodiac sign is not found, return an empty list and a message about the invalid sign
	5	Create a separate function to handle books about all zodiac signs together:
		Make a list of four books that cover the entire zodiac or astrology in general.
	6	For each book in the list about all zodiac signs, save the following information:
		Title of the book
		ISBN number
		Author’s name
		A link to Libris where the user can read more about the book
	7	In the function for all zodiac signs, randomly select a book from the list each time the function is used:
		Return the randomly selected book and its information
	8	Create the main function that runs the program:
		Ask the user to enter their zodiac sign (e.g., “Aries”, “Taurus”, “Gemini”)
	9	Use the first function to find the element and books for the zodiac sign the user entered:
		If an element and a list of books are found, proceed to step 10.
		If no element is found, go to step 12.
	10	If an element and a book list are found:
		Display the element associated with the user’s zodiac sign (e.g., “Fire” for Aries)
	11	For each book in the book list, print the book’s information:
		Print the title of the book
		Print the ISBN number
		Print the author’s name
		Print the publication year if available
		Print a link to Libris to find the book
	12	If the zodiac sign is not in the list:
		Display a message informing the user that the zodiac sign is invalid
		Ask the user to enter a valid zodiac sign
	13	Use the function to randomly select a book about all zodiac signs:
		Randomly select a book from the list of books about the entire zodiac or astrology in general
	14	Display information about the randomly selected book about all zodiac signs:
		Print the book’s title
		Print the ISBN number
		Print the author’s name
		Print a link to Libris where the user can read more about the book
	15	Run the main function to start the program.
	16	End the program.
	Program ends.
