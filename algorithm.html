    <h1>This is how we were thinking</h1>

    <body>What we wanted our algorithm to do was for the user to input their zodiac sign and then receive a result.
In the result, the user should receive the following information: the element associated with their zodiac sign, recommendations for four different books specifically about the user’s zodiac sign, and a randomly selected book (from four possible options) that covers all zodiac signs. Additional information for all books should include the title, year, ISBN, author, and a link to the book on Libris.
The pseudocode is written first to demonstrate what we want the algorithm to do. It starts with launching the program, what the user needs to do, and what the result for the user should be. We also included what happens if the zodiac sign is not on the list, as well as a function that, in addition to the four zodiac-specific books, randomly selects a book that covers all zodiac signs and then concludes.
The pseudocode is 50 lines long and includes everything required by the task, such as variables and if-else statements.
Once the pseudocode was written, we attempted to implement it using Python, as this was covered in our lecture. It wasn’t easy to get the solution right, but after some research, we managed to do it. Initially, we thought the user would enter their birth date, but we later decided that the user would only need to enter their zodiac sign to get their result.
