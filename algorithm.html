<h1>Algorithm</h1>

<article>
    <h2>What the algorithm is supposed to do</h2>
    
<p>What we wanted our algorithm to do was for the user to input their zodiac sign and then receive a result.
In the result, the user should receive the following information: the element associated with their zodiac sign, recommendations for four different books specifically about the user’s zodiac sign, and a randomly selected book (from four possible options) that covers all zodiac signs. Additional information for all books should include the title, year, ISBN, author, and a link to the book on Libris.
The pseudocode is written first to demonstrate what we want the algorithm to do. It starts with launching the program, what the user needs to do, and what the result for the user should be. We also included what happens if the zodiac sign is not on the list, as well as a function that, in addition to the four zodiac-specific books, randomly selects a book that covers all zodiac signs and then concludes.
The pseudocode is 50 lines long and includes everything required by the task, such as variables and if-else statements.
Once the pseudocode was written, we attempted to implement it using Python, as this was covered in our lecture. It wasn’t easy to get the solution right, but after some research, we managed to do it. Initially, we thought the user would enter their birth date, but we later decided that the user would only need to enter their zodiac sign to get their result.

 <h2>Workflow for Read the Stars</h2>
<ul>
<li>1)  Idea: to get book recommendations about a Zodiac sign plus four books about all the Zodiac signs</li>
<li>2)  Questions we discussed: Should the books be available at a Swedish library? Or available anywhere? Does it matter what language they're in? What information do we want?</li>  
<li>3)  Create database in Google Spreadsheet (convenience choice): There are 12 Zodiac signs, we wanted 4 books about every sign and another 4 books about all the signs.</li> 
<li>4)  We decided to include this information from Libris: title, author, isbn, link (to Libris), year, language, publisher, sign and element.</li>
<li>5)  Everyone collected data from Libris.</li> 
<li>6)  GitHub repository up, using the template proposed in the course.</li> 
<li>7)  Figure out GitHub!</li>
<li>8)  Perhaps we should skip publisher and language?</li> 
<li>9)  Created pages in GitHub.</li> 
<li>10) Linked tables (author-book) (sign-book) etc.</li>
<li>11) Fix relations between tables.</li> 
<li>12) Question: What skall we call the genral books on all the signs? "All".</li> 
<li>13) Questions: Should the user pick a date and then get recommendations or should the user pick their sign? We decided on the latter. A chart with dates will be provided on the website.</li> 
<li>14) Skip publisher and language!</li>
<li>15) Curate dataset.</li>
<li>16) Add texts to pages.</li>
<li>17) Write algorithm in pseudocode.</li> 
<li>18) No, let’s change it to one randomly selected book instead of all four books about all Zodiac signs.</li>
<li>19) Rewrite pseudocode.</li>
<li>20) Curate dataset again.</li> 
<li>21) Question: How about a picture next to the search result? No, pictures elsewhere. </li>
<li>22) Pictures with CC0-licences added to the repository.</li>   
<li>23) Algorithm in pseudocode rewritten – add year (of the book).</li>
<li>24) Algorithm in python - works for some of us</li>
<li>25) Testing – not working if you copy from Google drive, try Sublime text = success!</li>
<li>26) Curate data again to remove some information.</li> 
<li>27) Create csv-file. </li>
<li>28) Should we have some colors? Why not!</li>
<li>29) Accidently delete folder.</li> 
<li>30) Eventually find out how to create a new folder. </li>
<li>31) How much should we write about ourselves? Sign, occupation, favourite algorithm. Given name is enough on the web site.</li>
<li>32) Trim pseudocode.</li>
<li>33) Put everything together on GitHub.</li>
<li>34) Question: Did anyone remember that thing with quotation-marks in csv?</li>
<li>35) Add more images.</li>
<li>36) Translate pseudocode from Swedish to English.</li>
<li>37) Fix and polish.</li>
<li>38) An algorithm is born late in October, so Read the Stars is a Scorpio. All members of Group 2 are proud.</li>
