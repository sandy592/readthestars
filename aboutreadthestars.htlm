Your website should contain a motivation for the choices you made when you were conceptualising your dataset and algorithm. This motivation can be written on a separate page, or added to other pages where relevant. (e.g. choices pertaining to the dataset on the page describing the dataset; choices pertaining to the algorithm design on the page describing the algorithm; choices pertaining to the division of labor on the page describing the contributors).
