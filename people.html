<h1>About us</h1>

<article>
    <h2>How we worked with Read the Stars</h2>
    
    </article>
    <p>It started out with Emmas' idea about an algorithm to help people find books about their Zodiac sign, and also some books about all Zodiac signs. We quickly decided to go with the idea since it would make the rest of the task easier. First thing we did was Sandra creating a Google spreadsheet to collect data, where all of us contributed. To keep track of everything Emma started a project plan in the common Google-folder where we listed our individual contributions to avoid duplication work. Gabriella initiated a Messenger group for quick and easy communication swell as a Zoom-link for meetings. Sandra set up a repository using the course template on GitHub. 

        Johanna and Sara cleaned up the tables and Sara linked them together, fixed the relations and made the tables work together. During this project we solved many issues in our Messenger-chat, and the rest we talked about in Zoom-meetings. All feeling a bit stressed, Johanna took charge of the path forward during our second meeting and everyone had more specific tasks after that which was crucial for the result. Whilst splitting up the workload, we also supported each other.
